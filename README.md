Python assignments from my first-year Computing module in Electrical Engineering. Includes 'Sobs' (Student Objects) demonstrating core programming concepts, problem-solving, and computational thinking in engineering contexts. 

These assignments were crucial for the Computing course at Middlesex University, laying the foundation for advanced programming in later years. 

This repository showcases my early programming skills and serves as a reference for future work in Electrical Engineering
