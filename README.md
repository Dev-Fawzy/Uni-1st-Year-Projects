Hey, so these are my Python assignments from my first year in Electrical Engineering. 

We had to do these things called 'Sobs' (Student Objects) which were basically about learning how to code and solve problems.

It was for this Computing class at Middlesex Uni, and it was pretty important cuz it's gonna help with the harder stuff later on.

I'm just putting all this here to show what I've learned so far and maybe look back at it when I'm doing more advanced stuff in Electrical Engineering. Pretty cool, right?
